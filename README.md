### Description

CLIRC - Add Internet Relay Chat to your program :)

CLIRC is a group Visual Basic classes that add IRC functionality to your programs. It handles connecting to the IRC server, maintaining the connection, input buffer, decoding messages. All you have to do is put your code in the events it calls. It supports CTCP, and auto responds for FINGER, TIME, VERSION, PING. It auto-responds to PING from the server. This will save you a lot of time, whether you want to quickly program a powerful IRC bot, or if you want to make a full-fledged IRC client like mIRC either way this code is for you. This code is some of the best code I’ve seen in a long time and possibly the best IRC code for Visual Basic. If you like it then please pay some respect and chuck a vote my way ;) Hope you all enjoy! God Bless!
